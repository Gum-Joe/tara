# tara
An electron based file explorer (coming soon).

# Why?
I was tired of the lack of features in Windows's file explorer, whether that be tabs or tags, as well as the lack of customisability in most file explorers today. So I made tara, which will soon be a fully customisable, extensible file explore.  There's an electron app for everything these days: text editing, container management, checking your emails and even managing your social life - but not one for the most important part of computer: organising your files.

# Support
At the moment, only Windows is supported to speed up development.  Linux builds should follow once the main feature set is in.

# Building
`yarn && yarn run start`
